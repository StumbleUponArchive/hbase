# HBase ruby classes.
# Has wrapper classes for org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HBaseAdmin
# and for org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable.  Classes take
# Formatters on construction and outputs any results using
# Formatter methods.  These classes are only really for use by
# the hirb.rb HBase Shell script; they don't make much sense elsewhere.
# For example, the exists method on Admin class prints to the formatter
# whether the table exists and returns nil regardless.
