/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides the administrative interface to HBase cluster
 * replication. In order to use it, the cluster and the client using
 * ReplicationAdmin must be configured with <code>hbase.replication</code>
 * set to true.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Adding a new peer results in creating new outbound connections from every
 * region server to a subset of region servers on the slave cluster. Each
 * new stream of replication will start replicating from the beginning of the
 * current HLog, meaning that edits from that past will be replicated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Removing a peer is a destructive and irreversible operation that stops
 * all the replication streams for the given cluster and deletes the metadata
 * used to keep track of the replication state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Enabling and disabling peers is currently not supported.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As cluster replication is still experimental, a kill switch is provided
 * in order to stop all replication-related operations, see
 * {@link #setReplicating(boolean)}. When setting it back to true, the new
 * state of all the replication streams will be unknown and may have holes.
 * Use at your own risk.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To see which commands are available in the shell, type
 * <code>replication</code>.
